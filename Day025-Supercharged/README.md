I watched first half of the live stream of supercharged, 3D card flip. It is quite educational, I would say. It is one of the episode series of YouTube videos which do live web coding.  
The series is now season 3. I started to watch from season 1 to catch up watch what I have been missed these days. It turns out it does not do live stream in the first two seasons. In the first season, audiences would submit website for the host to review and spot what and which goes wrong. I have watched three videos and I already learnt so much.
