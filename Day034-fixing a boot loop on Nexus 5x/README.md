I got a nexus 5x as my daily driver. I am always keen to try the latest and greatest Google has to offer so I have joined the beta program since Android Nougat. Android O is just released on the beta program last week. I downloaded it immediately to try out the new setting page layout, faster boot time, etc. However, I found that my apps are not playing well with the new OS. They become quite laggy when I switch between apps and deleting text on the inbox app. No doubt it is caused by the newly installed OS so I decide to factory wipe the phone and see if it helps.
