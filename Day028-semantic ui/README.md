I wrote something on Medium  
https://medium.com/@jacky_ttt/day028-semantic-ui-fdd352f8befc#.uemb9eq1r  

I tried semantic ui in one of my recent projects. I have some thoughts upon the pros and cons of using it in my development process. For the record, it is the first time I used any ui framework for a project that goes to the production stage. I barely used bootstrap 3.x in a technology showcase site. It means that I am not going to make a comparison between semantic ui and other existing frameworks, like bootstrap, foundation, materialize, …, simply I don’t know the others well enough to one. I don’t want to embarrass myself…
