I wrote something on Medium

I am a heavy user of Youtube. I watched more than a few videos, ranged from gaming to technical product review, mostly gaming, on Youtube every single day. This is my way of knowing what other people are doing with their life, especially people who are in the same age group as mine. So, I could understand what I could achieve and how can I improve mine. Lately, I stumbled upon a youtuber, Morgan Yates. I believe she is a senior college student. She posts video about her school and daily life. By watching just a few of her videos, I have already known she is a very organized and self-disciplinary girl. In the video titled, Whatâ€™s In My Backpack 2017 for College!, she has a whole book just for writing down to-do list for each week. This is the kind of quality I have been missing for my whole life so I decided I will do my own version of weekly to-do list. (BTW, I like hand written things too. )
