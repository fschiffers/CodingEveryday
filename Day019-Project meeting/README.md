I wrote an article on Medium.  
  
I and my team have a regular meeting on Wednesday night. We discuss what side project we will do and eventually hope to kick off a start up. We have been working on a project for more than one month now, but, unfortunately we are still at the brainstorming stage on the same idea. I think the progress is too slow, if you ask me.
