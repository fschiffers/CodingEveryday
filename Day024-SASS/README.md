I wrote an article on Medium.

I looked into the document of sass, finding its syntax is very similar to Jade, a template engine. With the experience with Jade, I presume that learning SASS should not be a difficult task, if it just involve using the fundamental elements. I am planning to use sass for my next Nodejs project because I find plain css could not provide the readability I need. It is super important when you have to pick the code up without a sweat after you leave the project untouched for a while. At that time, you could glimpse at the code and know whatâ€™s happening if it is formatted and structured properly.
