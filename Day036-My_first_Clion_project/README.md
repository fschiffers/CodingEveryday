I have a c++ project that originally runs on Windows using Visual Studio and it is needed to convert to be able to run on Mac. I am a newbie when it comes to c++ and its project setup on Mac. I found that library dependency issue is the first thing I need to manage before I blindly include all the source code from the original project which will overwhelm me with error. The first library I want to include is GLM which plays a main role in my project.
