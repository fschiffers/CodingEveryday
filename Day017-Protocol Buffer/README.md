I had tried to use Wire to generate java class from .proto file.  
When I was researching on how to build a node js server to find nearby pokemon(Day013), I found a .proto file is included in the nodejs pokemon npm module I used.

It is the first time I encounter a project that uses Protocol Buffer as the schema of api communication. I got interested of how to use the Protocol Buffer in an android project.
