I wrote an article on Medium.  
  
I tried to learn pug, formerly jade, for the template engine of my nodejs project. I think it is quite easy to learn as the syntax is straight forward.  
Below four points are the benefits I consider quite usable after the first try:  
1. have inheritance (“extends”, have parent and child concept)  
2. can use “maxins” as reusable function (minimize code size)  
3. use intent for scoping (like python, don’t have the ugly and useless closing tag)  
4. can mix with js code (but have quite limited usage, but better than nothing).
